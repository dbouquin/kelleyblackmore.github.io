<h2>Summary</h2>
        
<p>The reasons for wanting to join Year Up come from the need to have a better focus as well as having less while going to school. Meeting people in my subject matter and having a more accelerated program that will get me into the work force will definitely help with this need. Personally, I do better by learning one subject at a time rather than taking the traditional 4 classes per week. I want join so that I can meet people with the same goals and educational desires so that we know that everyone we are surrounded by is serious about the program and wanting to meet the same goal. I believe that having a support group of like-minded students will really help me out as well as everyone involved. I would love to help other individuals in the program with their problems, as I would also like others to do the same for me. The program is ideal because it will allow me to work towards an internship in the field with a company that could potentially want to hire me for a full time job after the program is complete. This was partly why I joined the military, to get the work experience and learn new skills in a different environment other than the traditional classroom. All these reasons lead up to my desire to get in the program so that I can have a focused path in obtaining my goals and having a successful future in the computer science field. 
I truly believe that I am an excellent candidate for Year Up because I have a different aspects of myself that lead me to work hard and strive for success. Examples of this are the Military, many different types of work experience, and a passion for computer science as well as furthering the future of technology. I’m also team player, great at public speaking and I obtain a professional demeanor. Being in the military has taught me discipline, leadership, respect, safety, responsibility, teamwork, and to always be prompt and dependable. I can name a few more traits that I gained from being in the military for 5 years, but these are the ones that really stick out to me. Being in the Army isn’t always easy, and I constantly have to work hard in everything I do. For example, I had to show the confidence in myself to lead a team in a squad movement during a land navigation training. 
In my life, besides the Military, I have had many different jobs all over the board. There was something I loved about each and every job I had. I really hope to build a life and foundation for myself to where I don’t constantly have to move around. The jobs I had ranged from being a personal trainer to being a security guard and they all reinforced skills that I’ve learned over the years. Pulling all these traits together has gotten me to the place I am today, and I hope it will launch me to a career in computer science.
I grew up in Colorado being a very adventurous gamer. I know those two things don’t normally go together but I was very active in Boy Scouts and as well with anything that has to do with technology. As I was growing up, my parents always taught me to work hard to achieve my goals and that every mistake that I made would always have a consequence, along with a learning experience. They taught me that these are the things that should be valued in life, and hard work and perseverance is how I will get there. I’d say that these are the biggest lesson that I learned from them, and it will stay with me all throughout my life.
 I really believe that the Year up program will be great for me and lead me to where I’d like to go. I’ve had a wide variety of experiences within my life, and they each have taught me something different. Out of all of the attributes I’ve listed, above all, I’d say that the fact that I have a strong worth ethic and strive to reach my goals is the most important, and I know that this aspect about me will transfer just as easily to this program.
